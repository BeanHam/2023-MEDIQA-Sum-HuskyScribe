Guest_family: Hi there, he is my son Jay!
Doctor: Hi Jay, how are you today?
Patient: I am okay doctor.
Doctor: Tell me what is going on?
Guest_family: We went ice skating almost 10 days back and he slipped on the ice and landed straight on his right shoulder. Since then, he has been complaining of issues with his shoulder. He is not able to raise his hand above his head and sometimes at night he complains of numbness in his right hand fingers. That kind of made me worried.
Doctor: Hm, okay. Mom, did he get hurt anywhere else too, like head, face or chest? 
Guest_family: No, he landed on his shoulder thankfully. Didn't hit his head. He was also wearing a helmet.
Doctor: Okay, so are you giving him anything for his shoulder, like pain meds or anti inflammatory to ease his stiffness?
Guest_family: No, nothing. Although I gave him some honey for his sore throat. He has been complaining of a sore throat, he has a long standing history of strep throat and he did have some exposure to strep. 
Doctor: Hm, did he have any fever or rashes? 
Guest_family: No.
Doctor: Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation?
Guest_family: No.

Guest_family: Yes, and the doctor has prescribed him Adderall and Zoloft once a day. With medication he is doing well in school, he is socializing. Overall, he is maintaining his weight and tolerating the medications well.
Doctor: Okay, so what is the concern?
Guest_family: However, I have noticed that whenever he is not taking his medications, he is having anger outbursts which he is not able to control. He does realize that it's a problem but he can't help it, and this worries me. We have talked about getting help and he has agreed for counselling. I was just wondering if there is anything which can help him, any therapy or counselling session that might benefit him?"
54,"Doctor: How's it going? Are you ready for your physical today, sir? 
Patient: I am, but can we hurry? I have to get to work soon.

Doctor: Oh, wow. Do you have to lift any heavy products?

Doctor: Oh no. What happened? 
Patient: I don't know. I tried to get it fixed but nothing worked out, so I had to buy a new one and then being old kind of hit me. You know, I was not able to set it up. I was stuck on the pump settings and was having a lot of difficulties. With all this going on, I was not able to control my sugar over past two weeks and there might have been like some ups and downs in my levels which I could not notice or register.

Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: How about sweating, tired, or lightheadedness and or change in vision? Or any kind of confusion in mind?

Doctor: Are you working? 
Patient: Yes, I'm working as a medical coder. It is a full time job and you just keep busy. Sometimes I don't even realize that I missed my meal, but I do keep some snacks with me I'm just eating while completing my work. It might not be the best case scenario, but I don't get any time for any kind of physical activities. 
Doctor: Are you visiting your physician regularly? 
Patient: Of course. I'm very regular. I keep a track of my annual visits. My annual examinations. I take my dental visits after every six months, and I recently had my eye examination done. All was good.

Doctor: Do you check ankles for swelling? Have you ever noticed any swelling there? 
Patient: Yeah, I check my feet regularly and no swelling as such. I do wake up at night at least one time to go to the bathroom."
95,"Doctor: So, you were recently discharged from the hospital for home?
Patient: Yes, three days back. 
Doctor: Okay."
96,"Doctor: Hello, ma'am. How are you doing today? 
Patient: Not well. My allergies have been acting up again. 
Doctor: I see. Have you ever seen a doctor for your allergies? 
Patient: I have. My main doctor provided me with a report so that I could give it to you. Here is the report. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look at it.  I see you have a history of weight change. What is your current weight? 
Patient: I think I weigh in at one hundred and eighty pounds. 
Doctor: Thank you. I see your report says you have high blood pressure, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: I also see you have chronic issues with nasal inflammation, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, I do. It's really annoying when it comes back. 
Doctor: I can provide you with some medications to alleviate the chronic issues, but before I can, do you have any food allergies? 
Patient: I have some food allergies, but I'm not completely sure what foods I'm allergic too."
97,"Doctor: Any pain in the back?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Can you stretch it completely?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: No pain or tenderness in the center of the back or anywhere else? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Can you bend sideways for me? 
Patient: Sure. 
Doctor: No pain?
Patient: No pain.
Doctor: Any difficulty bending forward or backward?
Patient: No.
Doctor: So full range of motion. 
Patient: Yes."
98,"Doctor: How old are you, sir? 
Patient: I am twenty eight years old. 
Doctor: I understand that you are having some difficulties that brings you in today.
Patient: Yes, I have lost some feeling on my right side. 
Doctor:  Numbness? How long have you been experiencing the loss of feeling? 
Patient: It has been about three months now. It's strange I have had pain and numbness at the same time. 
Doctor: Have you had any other symptoms associated with this? 
Patient: I have been having some balancing problems. It has been getting worse. I don't know if this is related but I have been having trouble breathing while eating. I feel like I am choking on my food, but I am not, and I gasp for air. It is scary."
99,"Doctor: How has she been doing since her last admission? 
Guest_family: Not great. She still can't seem to hold her urine or bowels. For this reason, we've been using a diaper and changing it at least three times a day. 
Doctor: How does she communicate her needs to you? 
Guest_family: She'll usually point to things or wave her hands when she needs something. 
Doctor: I see. Does she have a visiting nurse or anyone who checks her vitals weekly? 
Guest_family: We have a nurse who comes in three times a week to help take care of her. 
Doctor: When did she first become wheelchair bound? 
Guest_family: About two years ago. 
Doctor: How often does she get turned over in bed to prevent bed sores? 
Guest_family: We try to adjust her once every hour or so. It's harder on the days where we don't have an extra set of hands."
100,"Doctor: When we did the surgery there were no complications with the patient. 
Guest_clinician: How did her skin look?
Doctor: Her skin was normal. It was pink, warm, and dry to the touch. Her subcutaneous tissue was also in normal condition."
101,"Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am. Before we begin, I just need a few pieces of information. 
Patient: Sure, no problem, doctor.
Doctor: First, how old are you?
Patient: I'm fifty six, doctor. 
Doctor: Good, did the nurses talk to you about the weight they took today?
Patient: No, they did not. 
Doctor: Well, ma'am, you're obese. That's posing a serious danger to your health. 
Patient: Yes, I know. I've been trying to lose weight. 
Doctor: Good, so, what seems to be troubling you today?
Patient: Well, I have a history of degenerative arthritis in my hips, so my other doctors have said.
Doctor: How have you been treated for this?
Patient: I had a right hip replacement with Doctor X in two thousand. 
Doctor: Did this help the pain?
Patient: Yes, on the right, but over the last three years or so the pain on the left hip has been getting worse. 
Doctor: Has it gotten worse faster recently?
Patient: Yeah, over the last few months it's gotten really bad. 
Doctor: What kind of medications are you taking for this?
Patient: Honestly, it's gotten so bad, its uncontrollable pain at this point. I'm taking narcotics now because it's so bad. 
Doctor: Are you able to do any activities?
Patient: No, the pain is messing with my daily living, activities are out of the question. 
Doctor: I think we should do another hip replacement on the left, ma'am. 
Patient: Me too, can you remind me the risk of infection from this surgery?
Doctor: Well, historically it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. 
Patient: Good, and will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, the whole time. You won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Good, yes, I want to do this procedure.
Doctor: The other risks include scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure. I would not worry about any of these things since you have had a replacement before with no issues."
102,"Doctor: And what about surgeries? Have you had any in the past?
Patient: Well, a part of my intestine was removed due to some obstruction.
Doctor: Ah, I see. Big or small?
Patient: Small intestine.
Doctor: Okay anything else? 
Patient: Yeah, my appendix was removed and--and then I had a vasectomy.
Doctor: Okay.
Patient: That's it, I think."
103,"Doctor: How old was your dad when he passed away from a heart attack? 
Patient: Sixty seven.  
Doctor: Did he have a history of any medical problems? 
Patient: Yeah, he had C O P D and smoked a ton.  
Doctor: And how about your mom? How is she doing? 
Patient: She's not bad. Turned eighty eight last week. She's recovering from lung cancer. Two years ago, she had a piece of her lung taken out. 
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that she's in recovery and staying healthy. Do you have any siblings? 
Patient: I have two brothers that are both younger than me. I also had a sister, but she passed away from pneumonia at only twenty months old. 
Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that."
104,"Doctor: Any medical concerns or issues in the past?
Patient: No."
105,"Doctor: With ten being the worst pain ever, out of ten, how would you rate your knee pain at rest? 
Patient: At rest, um, I'd have to say there's no pain. 
Doctor: Okay, what about when you move the left knee? We call this active motion, how would you rate it then?
Patient: When I move it, um, the front of the knee hurts. I'd say its about a five out of ten."
106,"Doctor: How's your family? Are they in good health? 
Patient: My mom just turned sixty one and my brother is thirty nine. I'd say they're both doing good for their age. 
Doctor: Always great to hear. Do you know of any medical problems that run in the family? 
Patient: My dad died of colon cancer at the age of forty eight. I think he may have also had pancreatic cancer, but we're not sure.  
Doctor: I'm so sorry for your loss. Cancer is a horrible disease.  
Patient: It's okay. It's been several years now since we lost him. My uncle on my dad's side also had bile duct cancer and colon cancer. 
Doctor: Is he still with us today? 
Patient: No, sadly. He passed away at thirty two years of age. Another one of my uncles on my dad's side had colon cancer in his forties. It seems to run deep in our family. 
Doctor: Oh my. Is there anyone else in your family who has battled cancer? 
Patient: I'd say about thirty some people on my dad's side had cancer. A lot of them had colon cancer and two girls had breast cancer. Oh and I remember learning from one of our cousins that we have some weird genetic syndrome that runs in the family, but I couldn't give you the name. I don't think any of us have been able to figure out the name. Sucks that we have so many problems. 
Doctor: It's definitely difficult to process, however, it's good that you and your family are aware so that you're able to seek preventative measures and get tested early for these particular cancers. If you recall the name of the genetic syndrome, please feel free to call me back so that I can update your records.  
Patient: Sure thing."
107,"Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am, I just need some information before we get started today. 
Patient: Absolutely, good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: My chart says here that you're fifty nine years old, is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: I also see that you have a history of breast cancer, is that correct as well?
Patient: Yes, that's also correct. 
Doctor: When were you diagnosed initially? 
Patient: Um, I was diagnosed in June of nineteen ninety four. 
Doctor: How has this been managed in the past, ma'am? 
Patient: Um, I've taken Zometa, Faslodex, and Aromasin. 
Doctor: How has the cancer progressed since you were diagnosed? 
Patient: The doctors said I had rising tumor markers. 
Doctor: What imaging have you done to evaluate the cancer? 
Patient: I've had a P E T C T Scan done. 
Doctor: What did that scan show?
Patient: It showed that the cancer was metastatic. 
Doctor: I see here that you were involved in a clinical trial for your breast cancer, can you tell me more about that, please? 
Patient: I was in the C T S U C four zero five zero two trial, and I was randomized into the ixabepilone plus Avastin group. 
Doctor: How did you respond to this treatment? 
Patient: Um, I had something called dose limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle. I skipped the Ixempra on the first and eighth days. 
Doctor: How did they respond once this happened? 
Patient: They just reduced the dose I was given. 
Doctor: How did you handle this reduced dose? 
Patient: Honestly, I've been tolerating the treatment pretty well. I only have some neuropathy. 
Doctor: Do you have any other concerns of note? 
Patient: Um, I thought that I had a perforated septum earlier this month, and I went to my E N T right away, but everything was okay. There was no perforation. 
Doctor: Okay, so, you're here for your eighth day of Ixempra, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor, that's correct."
108,"Doctor: I have to check for any swollen lymph nodes. I will go through different areas like in your neck, in your armpit, and in your groin. 
Patient: Yeah, that's okay. 
Doctor: Your neck looks clear. I cannot find any kind of swelling or abnormality there. 
Patient: That's good, right? 
Doctor: Yeah, it's true. Other parts also look clear."
109,"Doctor: I will check your skin for anything abnormal, okay? 
Patient: I'm okay with that. 
Doctor: Hm, I don't see any rashes or any red spots."
110,"Doctor: Do you have any allergies to medications? 
Patient: No."
111,"Doctor: Do you have any allergies?
Patient: Not that I know. 
Doctor: Any adverse reaction to any kind of medications?
Patient: No."
112,"Doctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?
 Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. 
Doctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?
Patient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. 
Doctor: Can you locate where the pain is?
Patient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  
Doctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. 
Patient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. 
Doctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?
Patient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. 
Doctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?
Patient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. 
Doctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?
Patient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. 
Doctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.
Patient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke."
113,"Doctor: Did anyone in your family have any medical issues? 
Patient: Well, you see, my father died of a brain tumor. Doctors tried their best, but no surgery was possible for him. 
Doctor: What about your mother? 
Patient: She's just a little obese, otherwise there is no medical issue."
114,"Guest_clinician: Were they discharged? 
Doctor: Yep, he was sent home with a taxi voucher."
115,"Doctor: Your platelet counts are normal, but you do have a disease that is called I T P.
Patient: What does it mean?
Doctor: So idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a disorder of low platelet count. 
Doctor: Do you know what platelets are?
Patient: Oh yeah.
Patient: Okay. Can it be treated?"
116,"Doctor: Have you ever had your glucose levels measured? 
Patient: No.  
Doctor: I would like to test your levels today. 
Patient: Okay."
117,"Doctor: Good morning, young man, and can I assume that you're his mother? 
Guest_family: Yes, doctor, good morning, that's correct. 
Doctor: Good, tell me a little more about your son, please. 
Guest_family: Well, he's seven years old now, and he's been healthy all his life. But he recently started having pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck. 
Doctor: What race does your family identify with?
Guest_family: We're white, doctor. 
Doctor: Okay, how long has he had this pain? 
Guest_family: It's been, um, about two months now. 
Doctor: Has the pain improved any since it began?
Patient: Well, it's a little better now. 
Guest_family: Yeah, he says it's almost gone now, but he was at a point where he was in so much pain that he would cry. 
Doctor: Is this behavior unusual for him?
Guest_family: Yes, he's not really a complaining kid. 
Doctor: I see. Was he playing and everything before this pain?
Patient: Yes, I like playing sports with my friends. 
Doctor: Has he had any illnesses, or stomach issues in the past? 
Guest_family: No, nothing major, he just has some allergies. 
Doctor: What kind of allergies? 
Guest_family: He just deals with seasonal allergies.
Doctor: So, does he just take a Claritin for this?
Guest_family: Correct. 
Doctor: Is there any swelling? 
Guest_family: Not really, the other doctor said he saw some though. 
Doctor: Are there any other major medical conditions that you're aware of, anything at all?
Guest_family: No, there's absolutely nothing to report.
Doctor: Has he ever had a rash on the painful area?
Guest_family: No. 
Doctor: Any diarrhea, fevers, weigh loss, or mouth ulcers?
Guest_family: No. Just canker sores, but no to everything else. 
Doctor: Is he going to the bathroom fine? What about visual issues?
Guest_family: No. 
Doctor: Okay. His lymph nodes look fine."
118,"Doctor: So Mister X, you don't smoke, do you? 
Patient: Nope, never picked up a cig my whole life.

Doctor: Are you married? 
Patient: I am a widowed.

Patient: Well, it's still pretty low. 
Doctor: You've been taking the Lantus at night? 
Patient: Yes, and the sliding scale Humalog before I have meals. 
Doctor: When is your blood sugar the lowest? 
Patient: Um, it's worst in the mornings. 
Doctor: Do you remember your levels at that time? 
Patient: It's in the seventies usually. 
Doctor: We decreased your Lantus from eighty four to sixty units, right? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. 
Doctor: That's a pretty considerable change in dosage. 
Patient: What do you think, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, I can't really explain why your glucose have not climbed despite the decrease in insulin. 
Patient: That's strange, doctor. 
Doctor: My staff tells me that your appetite is good, and you're eating as well as ever, is that correct? 
Patient: Yeah, I'm just a little fatigued, but otherwise, I'm doing well."
121,"Doctor: Do you smoke or drink?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Have you ever done drugs? Snort or I V?
Patient: No, never. I never got time for all that stuff. I moved to America in nineteen seventy three and I started working as a nurse in a newborn ward.
Doctor: Wow! So, you were a nurse?
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: So, what else do you like? What are your hobbies?
Patient: Well, I like gardening and also traveling. My last visit was to Las Vegas in May of two thousand. I stayed there for about six months.

Patient: Yeah, nothing else. Just that."
123,"Doctor: All your labs are negative, and it's been six months from your injury, is that right, sir?
Patient: Yes, that is correct. What is your plan of action here?
Doctor: Okay so I do not see any physical findings that might suggest any type of contamination. Your labs were negative, but I would like you to take precautions going forward to keep yourself protected. Try to avoid these situations in future by being informed. Always wear gloves.
Patient: I will try to educate myself and be vigilant on that part. I will try to prevent any such transmission. I will not expose myself to any intimate contacts."

Patient: Very dizzy.

Patient: When l sit up or get out of bed, I'll feel like I'm spinning around. 
Doctor: Okay. A rotational sensation. How long does it last?

Doctor: Do you feel this sensation any other time? 
Patient: Only when I roll over in bed. 
Doctor: I see. What direction do you feel like you're spinning in? 
Patient: I don't know. I just feel like I'm spinning. Sometimes I feel like I'll pass out though. 
Doctor: I see. The sensation stops when you sit down for several minutes, correct? 
Patient: Yeah. When I lie down, I feel better too. 
Doctor: I'm going to perform an exam on you. Could you look to your left and then to your right?
Patient: Yup.

Patient: I am okay. I am fifty seven years old. How about you? 
Doctor: I am well thank you. So Bariatric Surgery Center evaluated you today for band placement surgery for weight loss, right?
Patient: Yes that's when they found out I have gallstones and they want to take my gallbladder out before we do any weight loss surgeries.
Doctor: Yes we need to do that surgery before to avoid any risk of infections due to diabetes and it might infect the band.
Patient: They were supposed to do the surgery today. I wanted it to be done on December thirty first of two thousand nine, but Doc they said that my sugar is high today.
Doctor: Oh, let me see. Oh wow four thirty eight! It is high.
Patient: Yes, they are going to treat my high glucose in the hospital.
Doctor: Okay let's get admitted then. Also, how is your sleep apnea?
Patient: It is okay. Could be better."
126,"Doctor: So, tell me about your past surgeries?
Patient: I had my hernia repaired sometime back. In the past I also got my retina tear corrected surgically.

Doctor: Has the pain been progressing over the years or has it been the same?

Doctor: What part of your feet is it affecting?

Doctor: How long has this been happening for? 
Patient: Um. I guess the same amount of time. 
Doctor: The same amount of time as your feet? 
Patient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time.

Doctor: Are you having feelings of depression? 
Patient: Yes, I have depression. 
Doctor: Are you being treated for your depression? 
Patient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day.

Patient: Psychotherapist?
Doctor: Like a therapist or a counselor?

 Patient: Um they did a test. 
Doctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? 
Patient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. 
Doctor: John Hopkins? 
Patient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  
Doctor: What were the results of the test that they did?
Patient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.
Doctor: He said that specifically? 
Patient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.
Doctor: How long ago was that?
Patient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. 
Doctor: Hum? 
Patient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.
Doctor: What is his name?
Patient: Whose name?
Doctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?
Patient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.

181,"Doctor: So, tell me what is going on?
Patient: I am coughing blood!"
182,"Doctor: Hi there. How are you today? 
Patient: I am not felling well at all.  
Doctor: I am sorry to hear that.  What is going on? 
Patient: It started with a painful burning feeling when I pee.  Then I started having a pain in my left side.  Now my throat hurts."
183,"Doctor: Have you had any other hospitalization in the past?
Patient: Ah yes, I have been hospitalized a couple of times in the past. Once it was when I got pneumonia and other time I had an asthmatic attack.
Doctor: Okay."
184,"Doctor: How're you today, Mister X? 
Patient: I'm feeling pretty dandy, doc. 
Doctor: How's Misses X doing? 
Patient: She's doing quite well. She sends her hellos. 
Doctor: Please send her my greetings as well.  
Patient: Will do. I'm sure she's out partying right now. 
Doctor: That's a good one, Mister X. Don't think I forgot that neither of you drink or smoke. 
Patient: You caught me. She's actually dabbling in drugs. 
Doctor: I know you too well to believe that you've both started doing drugs. 
Patient: Nothing gets past you, doc."
185,"Doctor: Happy belated birthday! I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.
Patient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.
Doctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?
Patient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. 
Doctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?
Patient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. 
Doctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?
Patient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.
Doctor: When did you switch?
Patient: Within the last ten years or so.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement?
Patient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. 
Doctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?
Patient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.
Doctor: Do you have any voice tremors?
Patient: I do.
Doctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?
Patient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.
Doctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?
Patient: Two thousand one.
Doctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?
Patient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy."
186,"Doctor: How have you been feeling recently? 
Patient: Pretty good actually. My anxiety has calmed down a bit. I've gotten back into painting again, which I really enjoy. 
Doctor: Wonderful to hear. How are things at home? 
Patient: Honestly, that part of my life isn't so great. I've had a lot of trouble with my son recently. He spends a lot more time playing video games than he does on school. 
Doctor: Have you spoken to him about it? 
Patient: Oh all the time. He doesn't listen. 
Doctor: I'd recommend trying to reach a compromise with him so that he's able to get his work done as well. 
Patient: Yeah, his dad and I are planning to have another talk with him this weekend. 
Doctor: Hopefully, he'll realize the importance of setting aside time to get his work done.  
Patient: Fingers crossed. 
Doctor: Any family history of anxiety? 
Patient: Not that I know of. High blood pressure and strokes in the family, but nothing else."
187,"Doctor: Welcome, Mister X. Are you excited for your surgery today? 
Patient: I guess. This is my fifth surgery. At this rate, I'm going to have ten by next year.
Doctor: Oh, wow! You had four surgeries before? What were they?
Patient: Uhm. The only one I remember is my kidney. I have a history with this one. They rebuilt it, so it's running like a new car. 
Doctor: That's impressive. I think my nurse might have your past surgeries on file. Nurse? Do you have a file on his past surgeries? 
Guest_clinician: I do. Here you go, Doctor. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look now. I see you had a knee surgery, a hernia repair in your right groin, and an appendix removed, correct?
Patient: If it says it there, then it must be right. I honestly don't remember. My memory sucks."
188,"Doctor: Any known drug allergies? 
Patient: No, none."
189,"Doctor: Do you have a family history of arthritis? 
Patient: No, nobody that I know of. 
Doctor: What about other things, like high blood pressure? 
Patient: No, nothing like that either."
190,"Doctor: How about patient's medication?
Guest_clinician: Well, it is listed in his medical record. 
Doctor: Okay."
191,"Doctor: Does anyone else have this condition in your family? 
Patient: No, everyone is healthy.
Doctor: Okay."
192,"Doctor: And did you tolerate the medications well? 
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: So no complications."
193,"Doctor: Do you have any past or present medical conditions? 
Patient: I have high blood pressure and I am a type two diabetic."
194,"Guest_clinician: So, you discharged Mister Henley?
Doctor: Yes, he has been moved to a long term acute care facility under the supervision of Doctor Z.
Guest_clinician: Okay."
195,"Doctor: Welcome back. How have you been feeling? 
Patient: I am not doing so well.  My symptoms have become worse. 
Doctor: I am sorry to hear that. I would like to discuss dialysis treatments with you again. I think it is time. 
Patient: Okay."
196,"Doctor: Any fever?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Did you notice any changes in your weight? 
Patient: No, not really.
Doctor: Weakness or body aches? Any fatigue?
Patient: Nothing like that.
Doctor: Okay, good."
197,"Doctor: She was in the E R last week with a B A C of zero point ten.  
Guest_clinician: Oh, wow. 
Doctor: Unfortunately, it's nothing new. She has a long history of alcohol abuse. She's also been in and out of A A for a number of years.  
Guest_clinician: Does she have family? 
Doctor: Not entirely sure. She rarely if ever speaks of anyone else. Case managers have offered her resources, but she's unable to break her drinking habit. 
Guest_clinician: That's always sad to hear. I hope she's able to get the kind of help that she needs because visiting the E R over and over again isn't going to solve anything. 
Doctor: Exactly. I couldn't agree more."
198,"Doctor: Any surgeries in the past?
Patient: Um, I had a gastric bypass surgery. 
Doctor: And was it recent or do you remember when was it done?
Patient: Um, I think it was in two thousand and five or wait a minute actually it was done in December of two thousand seven.
Doctor: Alright."
199,"Doctor: Do you have any family medical health problems? 
Patient: My dad has high blood pressure. 
Doctor: Any your mother, does your mother have any health problems? 
Patient: My mother passed away in a car accident. 
Doctor: I am so sorry, miss. 
Patient: She was healthy though. I never knew of any health problems that she had."
