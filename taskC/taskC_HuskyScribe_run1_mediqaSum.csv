HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux who presents today for her annual exam. She has been walking like she was told to do and exercising and doing yoga which has helped with her arthritis a lot. She has had no issues with joint pain in the last year but when she starts to get stressed, they start to flare up again. She does have some edema and some erythema on her methotrexate 2.5 mg once a week. For her atrial fibrillation, we would like to refer her to cardiology for a cardiac ablation which just maps out where it comes from and burns it so that it doesn't come back into normal sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of cough and sore throat. He also has a history of rashes on his nose as well. His energy level is fairly normal, but he seems to be irritable because he can't go to sleep. He does have some baby vicks on his feet last night to try and help him breathe. He also uses a humidifier. He denies any other medications.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 14-day-old male who presented to the emergency department with a history of sinusitis. He has been doing saline mist in his nose, which is clear at this time. He also has had a cough that is not barky. He did have a sore throat and he has been pulling on his ears as well. His rectal temperature was 100.3. He also had a low-grade fever.

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes type II, mild intermittent asthma. He has been playing tennis more recently and his pain has been worse over the last three weeks or so. His pain is described as acute lateral epicondylitis of his right elbow which is also known as tennis elbow. This is due to overuse likely due to the increase in tennis activity. He states that he has not had any trauma recently falling on it or feeling a pop anywhere but rather just when he is resting his right forequicksibc blood sugars are unchanged from prior exam. I will also check a a a chem-12 blood test and then we'll review of his blood sugars at that time.

The patient is on metformin 500 mg q.d. but since the last visit we have increased it to metformin 500 mg q.d. blood sugars may be a bit off due to the cadberry eggs and asthma. He is still taking flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed.
