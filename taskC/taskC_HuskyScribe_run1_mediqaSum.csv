The patient is a right flank pain with no tenderness to palpation and cva tenderness due to a kidney stone. The patient has had a CT scan prior to coming in which showed a stone measuring 5 cm in size located on the proximal right ureteral duct. The patient was given a strainer by his pcp and that has been working for him but so far nothing significant [doctor] so he is continuing on that ibuprofen 50 mg once again in 1 to 2 weeks time we will see him again in one to two weeks when he comes in for further treatment possible lithotripsy or shockwave treatment.
