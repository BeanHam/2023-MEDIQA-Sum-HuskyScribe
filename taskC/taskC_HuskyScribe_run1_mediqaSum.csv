D2N185,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
The patient is a 14-year-old female who was previously healthy, now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney. She was treated for stomach virus, and they sent her back home. The next day she was twice as bad as the first day. They did followup with her primary care physician, but he was heading out on vacation, so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then he was out the door. She continued throwing up, in a lot of pain, so he took work off to help her. After that, we went down to jacksonville, and they did see her again and they did do some more testing and they did not think they did any tests to see what the infection was coming from. A week or two later, she would have a fever and then it just stopped. She has had no problem since then, but the doctor suspects that she has had obstructive neuropathy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 14-year-old right-handed female who presents for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney. She was found to have a small left flank appendectomy, which was treated for stomach virus. The next day she was throwing up in a lot of pain and they sent her back to the hospital. They did a followup with her primary care physician, who was out of town on vacation. After that, they found some cysts on her kidney and ovaries and possibly some other places. She has had no more vomiting since then started having symptoms and now she has not had any episodes of this since. However, she has been complaining of abdominal pain when she peesing. She does have a history of hypertension. Her father died of a massive heart attack in his 40's from dialysis.

On an annual basis, she will have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function, complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that there is no protein in her, and blood pressure check. Additionally, she will avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt for tylenol instead.

The patient is a 14-year-old female who was previously healthy, now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney. She was treated for stomach virus, and they sent her back home. The next day she was twice as bad as the first day. They did followup with her primary care physician, but he was heading out on vacation, so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then he was out the door. She continued throwing up, in a lot of pain, so he took work off to help her. After that, we went down to jacksonville, and they did see her again and they did do some more testing and they did not think they did any tests to see what the infection was coming from. A week or two later, she would have a fever and then it just stopped. She has had no problem since then, but the doctor suspects that she has had obstructive neuropathy.

D2N207,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
This is a patient who was seen by a nephrologist about a month ago. He has had some shortness of breath for about a week now. The patient states that the last time he saw his nephrologist [about a month ago] he was given a lower dose of lasix and it seemed to be working better. He continues to take it daily. He does not notice that his urination has been any less recent. He also states that the last time he was on motrin which lasted 4/5 days slowly went away.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient has a history of acute heart failure exacerbation. He states that his blood pressure is about 135/80, and that the pumping function of his heart was a little low so he had a stent placed in his right coronary artery at that time. He states that he has been taking lasix daily for about six months and he seems to be doing better but he does have some knee pain and he has not been taking motrin because he says it is not very effective [dil] tylenol as well. I do appreciate a 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on the lower extremity i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on the chest exam a 3 out of 6 systolic systomural systomystolic a 2+ pitting edema bilaterally
